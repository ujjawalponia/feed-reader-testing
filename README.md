# [Udacity Feed Reader Testing](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)

# Project Overview

This pproject is all about reading RSS Feed for web-based application. The original developer of this application have clearly seen the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and they even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.......


## Why this Project?

Every application needs to to tested before it's launch, And Feed Reader Tesing project is also a part of that testing process.Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. Almost every application fails dduring it's testing then developers write the stable and error free code. So For writing Error less code we always needs testing.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!
